                        <h6>Is a very important part of my life, I was born in a family that very much values literacy and have unique interpretation of poetry. Khmer poetry are some of the poetry I have learned. There are many form of this poetry, but all of them have something to do rhymth.
                        When I am at Liger, I was introduced to a different world of poetry. I was captured because there is no such rules and you can express your feeling in any type of way you want.  </h6>
